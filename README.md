**Background**: Most engineers would need to deal with different unit systems while solving engineering problems, they would need to convert the value in one unit to another. For example, for purchasing pipes in the U.S. would require knowing the desired length and thickness in imperial units, such as inches and feet. On the other hand, even with the same unit system, the units used can also be different in different domain, such as blood pressure is measured in mmHg in biological system, the pressure in a chemical reactor is evaluated in Pascal (Pa) or kPa while there is a gas-phase reaction.

In engineering practice, length, flow rate, velocity, pressure, etc. are commonly measured in different devices with different unit system. The intent of this software, *unit converter*, is to help engineers to convert different measured values to the values that are desired in their workflow in a convenient and fast way. 

**Requirements** â€“ User Stories:

1.	Convert a pressure value measured in mmHg to Pa
2.	Convert a pressure value measured in kPa to mmHg
3.	Convert a velocity value measured in m/s to kg/h
4.	Convert a velocity value measure in mi/h to m/s
5.	Convert a flow rate measured in ml/min to m3/s
6.	Convert a flow rate measured in ft3/s to ml/min
7.	Convert a length measured in m to inches
8.	Convert a length measured in feet to m
